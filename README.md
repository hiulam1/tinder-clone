# Tinder Clone

This is a Tinder clone mobile application built with React Native, integrating Google Sign-In for authentication and Firebase for backend services. The app allows users to swipe through profiles and interact with matches.

### Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your machine<br>
Expo CLI installed globally (npm install -g expo-cli)<br>
Google Firebase project set up with Firestore database and Authentication enabled Steps<br>
Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/hiulam1/tinder-clone.git<br>
Navigate to the project directory:<br>
cd tinder-clone<br>
Install dependencies: npm install<br>
Replace your firebase configurations with your actual Firebase and Google Web Client IDs.<br><br>

As this app requires custom native code, it cannot be used in Expo Go and would require you to create a development build:
