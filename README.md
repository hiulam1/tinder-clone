# Tinder Clone

This is a Tinder clone mobile application built with React Native, integrating Google Sign-In for authentication and Firebase for backend services. The app allows users to swipe through profiles and interact with matches.

### Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your machine
Expo CLI installed globally (npm install -g expo-cli)
Google Firebase project set up with Firestore database and Authentication enabled Steps
Clone the repository to your local machine:

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/hiulam1/tinder-clone.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd tinder-clone
Install dependencies: npm install
Replace your firebase configurations with your actual Firebase and Google Web Client IDs.

As this app requires custom native code, it cannot be used in Expo Go and would require you to create a development build:

### Features

User authentication using Google Sign-In
Swipe functionality for browsing profiles
Real-time messaging with matches
Firebase integration for backend services
